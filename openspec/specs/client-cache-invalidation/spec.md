## Purpose
What a screen shows after a mutation, and how it learns that data changed elsewhere, now that
`revalidatePath` no longer exists. The 33 call sites that used to state which screens a write
invalidates had to survive the move without becoming a component-by-component guess. The
contract that replaced them is `src/lib/query/keys.ts`, whose header carries the table
reconciling every one of the 33 against the key that replaced it.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Every mutation SHALL declare what it invalidates

`revalidatePath` had **33** call sites in `src/lib/actions/`, not the 41 this spec first
claimed: `git grep -c revalidatePath -- 'src/lib/actions/*.ts'` counts *lines*, and several
lines carried two calls. `keys.ts` §header records the recount. Each call was a claim about
which screens are now stale —
`createClub` names `/clubs` and `/clubs/explore`; `likePostcard` names the feed, the card, and
the postcard's club timeline if it has one. Those claims SHALL be preserved as cache keys, not
rediscovered.

#### Scenario: The invalidation set is derived, not reinvented
- **WHEN** an action is migrated
- **THEN** its new invalidation SHALL cover at least the routes its `revalidatePath` calls named
- **AND** any route deliberately dropped SHALL be recorded with its reason, since three of
  today's calls target routes chosen by convention rather than necessity

#### Scenario: A mutation's own screen updates without a navigation
- **WHEN** a rider likes, joins, leaves, hides, blocks, reports, comments or posts
- **THEN** the screen they are on SHALL reflect the change without a manual refresh

#### Scenario: A failed mutation leaves no false state behind
- **WHEN** a mutation fails after an optimistic update
- **THEN** the optimistic change SHALL be reverted and the failure SHALL be shown
- **AND** a like, join or RSVP SHALL NOT remain visually applied after the write was refused

### Requirement: Counts SHALL stay per-viewer and SHALL NOT be cached across viewers

Every cache key SHALL be scoped to the signed-in rider, and no cached value MUST survive a
sign-out.

Likes and comments deliberately carry no denormalised count, because the correct count is
per-viewer: blocks and hides change it. A shared cache keyed only by postcard id would leak one
viewer's count to another.

**There are two unread counts now, not one, and the second is read on every tab-root screen.**
`club_unread_counts()` is read on one screen; the notification badge is read on four, which makes
the per-rider scoping rule load-bearing in a place the original scenario did not contemplate — a
count leaked across a sign-out would follow the next rider onto the first screen they open rather
than onto one they might never visit.

#### Scenario: Cache keys include the viewer
- **WHEN** any list, count or roster is cached
- **THEN** the key SHALL be scoped to the signed-in rider
- **AND** no cached value SHALL be reused across a sign-out and sign-in

#### Scenario: Blocking removes content already on screen
- **WHEN** a rider blocks another rider from the postcard overflow menu
- **THEN** the blocked rider's postcards, comments, likes and roster rows SHALL disappear from
  every cached view the blocker holds, not only from the next fetch
- **AND** the deck SHALL NOT skip past the card that was open, which is the behaviour the deck
  fix of 2026-08-05 established

#### Scenario: Unread counts follow the same rule
- **WHEN** `club_unread_counts()` is read
- **THEN** its result SHALL be cached per rider only, since the function is `security invoker`
  precisely so blocks and hides apply to it

#### Scenario: The notification badge follows it on four screens rather than one
- **WHEN** the unread notification count is read from any tab-root screen
- **THEN** its result SHALL be cached per rider only, for the same reason and by the same
  mechanism — the count function is `security invoker` so that blocks and subject resolvability
  apply to it
- **AND** `clearQueryCache()` on sign-out SHALL be what enforces it, rather than a per-key
  expiry, because a shared device is the case this protects and an expiry is a race

### Requirement: Stale data SHALL be bounded and visible

Every screen SHALL revalidate when the app is foregrounded. Freshness SHALL be expressed as a
revalidation rule, and a subscription SHALL be permitted only for a stream that has been
explicitly specified as live — never as the default mechanism for keeping a screen fresh.

No screen currently knows that data changed elsewhere; the server re-rendered on navigation and
the question never arose. A cached client can hold a list open for as long as the rider leaves
the app running.

**The `Real-time is not assumed` scenario deferred this decision to "the Inbox epic", and that
epic has now made it.** Per-ride chat is the first stream in this app specified as live. What
changes is narrow and is stated as a narrowing rather than a relaxation: one named stream may
carry a subscription, and everything else stays on revalidation. A subscription is an
optimisation **on top of** the revalidation rule and never a replacement for it — a client that
trusts an event stream to have filled a gap shows a thread with a hole in it and no indication
that anything is missing, because missed events are never replayed.

The rest of the subscription contract — lifecycle, channel naming, publication membership,
per-subscriber authorization, optimistic reconciliation — is **not** this capability's, and is
deliberately not restated here. It lives in `realtime-subscriptions`, so that the second live
stream in this app inherits it rather than rediscovering it.

#### Scenario: Returning to the app refreshes what is on screen
- **WHEN** the app is foregrounded after being backgrounded
- **THEN** the visible screen SHALL revalidate its data
- **AND** this SHALL hold for a screen carrying a subscription exactly as it does for one that
  does not

#### Scenario: A ride whose details changed is not acted on stale
- **WHEN** a rider RSVPs to a ride whose departure time or meeting point has changed since the
  screen loaded
- **THEN** the write SHALL still be attempted against the current row, and the screen SHALL
  reflect the current values afterwards rather than the ones it was showing

#### Scenario: Real-time is not assumed
- **WHEN** freshness is specified for a screen
- **THEN** it SHALL be expressed as a revalidation rule by default
- **AND** a subscription SHALL be added only where a specification names that stream as live,
  which today is the per-ride message thread and nothing else
- **AND** the existence of one subscription SHALL NOT be read as permission to add others, since
  each carries a socket, a lifecycle and a per-subscriber authorization question of its own

#### Scenario: A live screen still revalidates
- **WHEN** a screen holds a subscription and the socket reconnects, or the app is foregrounded
- **THEN** the screen SHALL refetch its current state rather than assuming the events it missed
  will arrive
- **AND** the refetch SHALL reconcile with what the client already holds, matched by id, rather
  than replacing it and losing the rider's position

#### Scenario: A cache key fed by a subscription obeys every other rule unchanged
- **WHEN** a subscription writes into the query cache
- **THEN** it SHALL write through the same keys spelled in `src/lib/query/keys.ts`, never a
  string composed at the subscription site
- **AND** the key SHALL be scoped to the signed-in rider and SHALL NOT survive a sign-out, per
  the per-viewer rule this capability already carries

### Requirement: Redirect-after-write SHALL survive the loss of server redirects

A successful create SHALL navigate the rider to the created resource or the list containing it,
and MUST NOT leave the form indistinguishable from never having been submitted.

Twelve action call sites end in `redirect()` from `next/navigation` — signup, both onboarding
steps, password update, sign-out, club creation, ride creation, postcard creation. A client
mutation cannot redirect from the server, and the redirect is load-bearing in at least two
places: it is what makes "posted" distinguishable from "not submitted yet" when both states
are `{ error: null }`.

#### Scenario: Success is distinguishable from the initial state
- **WHEN** a create action succeeds
- **THEN** the rider SHALL be navigated to the created resource or the list that now contains it
- **AND** the form SHALL NOT be left in a state indistinguishable from never having been
  submitted

#### Scenario: Onboarding still advances one step at a time
- **WHEN** the username step succeeds
- **THEN** the rider SHALL land on the location step, and SHALL NOT be able to reach it before
  the username is set, matching the guard's current rule

### Requirement: A count and the list it summarises SHALL be invalidated together and read through the same predicate

Where a screen shows both a count and the list it counts, the two SHALL share a cache key prefix
so that no invalidation can reach one without the other, and both SHALL be produced by reads
subject to the same row security.

**A badge that disagrees with its list is a defect the rider cannot clear and cannot report
usefully.** It has two independent causes and this repo has the ingredients for both: a
`security definer` count reads past predicates the list obeys, and two cache keys under different
prefixes drift the moment one action invalidates only the cheaper one. `club_unread_counts()`
already avoids the first by being `security invoker`; nothing yet states it as a rule.

#### Scenario: One invalidation reaches both
- **WHEN** anything invalidates a count
- **THEN** the list it summarises SHALL be invalidated in the same call, by prefix
- **AND** a call site SHALL NOT be able to name one without the other

#### Scenario: A definer-rights count is refused as a mechanism
- **WHEN** a count is implemented
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT bypass any predicate the corresponding list obeys
- **AND** `security definer` SHALL NOT be used to make a count cheaper, because the saving is a
  badge that never clears on a screen that is empty

#### Scenario: The rider never sees a nonzero badge over an empty list
- **WHEN** the count and the list are both fresh
- **THEN** a nonzero count SHALL imply at least one row in the list
- **AND** the reverse SHALL hold for zero

#### Scenario: Agreement is a property of the predicate, not of a filter the renderer applies
- **WHEN** a row is counted but cannot be rendered — its actor or its subject does not resolve for
  the reader
- **THEN** the repair SHALL be to add the missing conjunct to the **predicate both reads share**, so
  the row is in neither
- **AND** dropping it in the component SHALL NOT be the repair, because that produces a nonzero
  count over a shorter list, which is precisely what this requirement forbids
- **AND** "render nothing for that row" SHALL be recognised as the same defect written as an
  instruction: a list of ten that draws nine is a list of nine with a wrong badge

#### Scenario: A failed count shows nothing rather than a stale value
- **WHEN** a count read fails
- **THEN** the badge SHALL be absent
- **AND** it SHALL NOT render the last successful value, because a dot the rider cannot clear by
  visiting the screen is worse than a missing one

### Requirement: A cached row whose subject the reader may no longer see SHALL be evicted by the database, not by the component that renders it

Where a cached list holds rows that point at another resource, the decision to drop a row whose
target has become invisible SHALL be made by the query, and no component SHALL filter a list for
visibility.

Decision #2 already forbids client-side block filtering. This extends the same rule to the wider
case that notifications introduce: a row can become unrenderable because the *reader's own*
relationship to the subject changed — they left a club, a club turned private — with no block
anywhere. A component filtering that case would make the count and the list disagree by
construction, and would put a visibility rule in the one place this project has decided it must
never live.

#### Scenario: The query decides, not the renderer
- **WHEN** a list contains a row whose subject the reader can no longer read
- **THEN** the row SHALL be absent from the query result
- **AND** no component, data function or action SHALL drop it after the fact

#### Scenario: An eviction is not a deletion
- **WHEN** a row stops being returned because the reader's relationship to its subject changed
- **THEN** the underlying row SHALL survive
- **AND** it SHALL be returned again if that relationship is restored, with its original ordering
  and read state

#### Scenario: A membership change invalidates everything that could depend on it
- **WHEN** a rider joins or leaves a club
- **THEN** every cached list whose contents can be gated by that membership SHALL be invalidated,
  not only the club's own screens
- **AND** over-invalidating SHALL be the chosen direction, matching the existing rule that a
  refetch is cheaper than a correctness bug
